          <h2 >FIRST FEMALE TEACHER OF INDIA</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Savitribai Phule</b> (3 January 1831 to 10 March 1897) was a social reformer of India. She was a poet from Maharashtra. 
            She is known as the "first female teacher of India".
            She worked on improving the rights of women in India with her husband. Her husband's name was Jyotirao Phule. 
            They started the first Indian girls school in Pune, at Bhide wada in 1848. She tried to end social class and unfair treatment based on sex in Indian society.
           She was an important person of the social reform in Maharashtra.
           Savitribai Phule was a trailblazer in providing education for girls and for ostracized portions of society. She became the first female teacher in India (1848) and opened a school for girls with her husband, Jyotirao Phule. 
           She went on to establish a shelter (1864) for destitute women and played a crucial role in grooming Jyotirao Phuleâ€™s pioneering institution, Satyashodhak Samaj, (1873) that fought for equality of all classes.
           Her life is heralded as a beacon of womens rights in India. 
           She is often referred to as the mother of Indian feminism.
